# Hi, I'm Dave Ejezie 👋

**IT-focused professional transitioning into 1st Line IT Support** — with hands-on experience operating enterprise-grade systems in a live corporate environment at a global media company in London.

My day-to-day involves administering **Genetec CCTV**, **Envoy visitor management**, and **electronic access control** platforms, alongside Microsoft 365 incident triage and coordination with internal IT teams. I build lightweight automation scripts to reduce repetitive support tasks and improve how helpdesk workflows operate.

## 📂 Helpdesk Automation Scripts

Practical scripts built around real IT support scenarios. The goal is simple: reduce repetitive manual tasks, surface useful information faster, and make support processes more reliable.

| Script | Language | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `system-health-check` | PowerShell | Checks disk, RAM, CPU, services, and network — outputs a formatted diagnostic report |
| `incident-log-reporter` | Python | Parses helpdesk incident CSVs and generates summary reports by category, priority, and resolution time |

> These scripts reflect the kind of work I do alongside standard support duties — not just fixing issues, but building small tools that help teams operate more efficiently.
