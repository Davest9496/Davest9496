I am a Full-Stack Software Developer who loves building digital solutions for businesses. I would love to combine my passion for Marketing and technical skills to empower business to push towards growth and efficiency.

Proficient in programming languages including TypeScript, NodeJS, React, Angular, Postgres and ScSS. I am using the high-value skills acquired from the just concluded Udacity nano-degree to build an e-commerce website which will include admin dashboard for analytics, and also, a Feedback System app for freelancers and businesses, all personalised for different business needs.

I am committed to life-long learning, and I continuously seek to broaden my understanding of software development methodologies and best practices.
